WeatherPy - "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

OBSERVABLE TRENDS BASED ON THE DATA

1.	Scatter plot Latitude vs Temperature: As you might expect, temperature is the variable that most closely correlates with proximity to the equator.  Cities located 20 degrees above and below of the equator have higher temperatures than cities located further from the 0-degree line.  However, it's noticeable that the temperatures close to 100 degrees Fahrenheit appear in cities located between 35 to 40 degrees up and down the equator line. The lowest temperatures were registered in cities between 40 to 80 degrees to the north. It’s more likely that cities between 35 degrees to the north and 35 degrees to the south of the equator line have higher temperatures that cities located above this numbers.

2.	Scatter plot Latitude vs Humidity: Although cities located between +/- 15 degrees from the equator have percentages of humidity higher than 40%, there are cities that can have the same percentage in a very wide range of latitude.

3.	The last two scatter plots, latitude vs cloudiness and latitude vs wind speed, don’t have a clear trend. Cities would have sunny days as much as cloudy days. By the same token, they can have windy days and calm days.  Distance from the equator to city is less likely to be a factor that influences cloudiness or wind speed.
